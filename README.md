# Atecna - Test Developer Web Fullstack JS

For this project, you will be fetching and displaying data from the Twitch API.
You can find the documentation for the Twitch API [here](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api)

> Please note that in order to access the twitch API you'll have to create a Twitch account.

**Objective**

Your goal will be to build a simple web dashboard with the following 2 features:

You will need to create a Web Socket connection to display the number of viewers for Chess (https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Chess) that automatically updates a counter in real time (*keep in mind the request throttling limit of the Twitch API*).

We would like a line Chart that compares in real time the number of viewers for the following 3 games:

- Hearthstone https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Hearthstone
- Rocket League https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Rocket%20League
- Dota 2 https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Dota%202
